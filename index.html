        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>
          My name is <em><b>Igashi Michael</b></em
          >, a hardware Engineering student of FUTMinna pursuing software
          engineering.
          <br />
          I enrolled to learn backend engineering in AltschoolAfica within the
          space of a year. With my knowledge of frontend, <br />
          I intent to become a full stack by next year after the program. <br />
          Below is my matric number:

      <div id="Reasons">
        <h2>Reasons for joining Altschool</h2>
        <p>here are the main reason why I joined AltschoolAfica:</p>
        <h4><li>Well Structured Learning Plan</li></h4>
        <p>
          Web development is a very broad course. One can easily waste time and
          energy learning anything and everything on Youtube. Learning on
          youtube isn't bad but,
          <br />
          with Altschool, I will be more focused on things that truly matter.
        </p>

        <h4><li>Great Community and Interactive Learning Circle</li></h4>

        <p>
          The feeling of working and sharing ideas with great minds from
          different part of the world is fulfilling.
        </p>

        <h4><li>Fame</li></h4>
        <p>Altschool is famous. I will have a greater chance with employers</p>
